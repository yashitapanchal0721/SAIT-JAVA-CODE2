
//Class is a user-defined datatype that encapsulates 
//state(variable) and behaviour(method) into a 
//single unit. 

//Encapsulation
//It is the mechanism of wrapping data(variables) and 
//methods together into a single unit and restricting 
//the direct access of the data using access modifiers.
// Variable are kept private and used by public getters/setters. 

//Abstraction
//It is the process of hiding internal implementation
//details and showing only essentail functionality 
//to the user.

//Inheritance
//It is the mechanism by which one class accquires
//the properties and behaviour of another class .

//Polymorphism
//It is the ability of a method or object to take 
//multiple forms
